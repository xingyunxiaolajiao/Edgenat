## Moving to Spain: Key Considerations for Living and Working Abroad

Making the leap to live and work in Spain is a significant life change. Here, we outline the most important factors to consider, including taxation, banking, housing, and employment.

---

## Understanding Spanish Taxes

If you spend more than 182 days per year in Spain or have primary economic interests there, you are considered a **tax resident**. Tax residents are subject to the **Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas (IRPF)**, which applies to total global income. Spain uses a calendar year for taxation, and treaties with countries like Belgium and the Netherlands prevent double taxation.

**Key Points to Note**:
- Tax obligations apply if you meet the residency criteria.
- International agreements help avoid paying taxes in both Spain and your home country.

## Opening a Spanish Bank Account

For stays longer than six months, opening a bank account in Spain is highly recommended. Foreigners can choose between **resident accounts** and **non-resident accounts**.

### Requirements for Non-Resident Accounts
- Valid identification (e.g., passport).
- A **Certificado de No Residencia**, obtained from the local police station within 15 days of opening the account.

**Tip**: If your bank insists on unnecessary documentation, consider visiting another branch or switching banks.

**Pricing and Services**:
- Non-resident accounts are similar to resident accounts in terms of fees and services.
- Non-residents may face restrictions, such as difficulty obtaining credit cards or overdraft facilities.

## Renting or Buying Property in Spain

### Renting in Spain
Spain has the **lowest rental rate in the EU at 13%**, compared to a 40% EU average. This is partly because most Spaniards prefer buying homes. However, rental prices have risen due to increasing demand.

- **Monthly Rent**: Expect to pay at least €900/month for a furnished apartment in cities like Madrid or Barcelona.
- **Shared Flats**: A cheaper alternative, costing around €500/month.

**Best Times to Rent**:
- May to July offers the best opportunities.
- Avoid September when students return to the cities.

## Working in Spain

Finding a job in Spain, particularly as a foreigner, can be challenging. The job market is divided into professional roles and the **tourism sector**, the latter offering seasonal opportunities.

### Tips for Job Hunting
- **Networking**: Many jobs are filled through personal connections.
- **Adapt Your CV**: Spanish CVs emphasize education first and include detailed lists of additional qualifications.
- **Be Proactive**: Don’t wait for responses—follow up with companies directly.

**Freelancing Opportunities**  
Freelancing through platforms like [Fiverr](https://bit.ly/FiVErr) offers expats location independence. It enables you to work globally, earn in different currencies, and build an international portfolio while living in Spain.

## Employment Contracts

Spanish employment contracts must be registered with the **Instituto Nacional de Empleo (INEM)** before the first day of work. Written contracts are required for part-time, temporary, or training jobs lasting more than four weeks.

---

## Working Hours and Salaries in Spain

- **Working Hours**: Spain operates on a 40-hour workweek.
- **Minimum Wage**: In 2022, it was €13,300 annually for workers over 18 years old.

Salaries vary by province, with higher wages typically found in Madrid and Barcelona. While managerial salaries in these cities are competitive with the rest of Europe, average workers earn less than their counterparts in other EU countries.
