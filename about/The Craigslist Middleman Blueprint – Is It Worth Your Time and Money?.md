## What Is The Craigslist Middleman Blueprint?

The Craigslist Middleman Blueprint is an online course that provides step-by-step instructions on how to start a middleman business. Essentially, you act as the "realtor" between buyers and sellers, purchasing services from one platform and selling them at a markup on Craigslist.

The process works as follows:
1. Create an ad on Craigslist offering a service (e.g., logo design).
2. When a client contacts you, negotiate the price and delivery timeline.
3. Collect payment via PayPal.
4. Outsource the service to a freelancer on **Fiverr** for a lower cost.
5. Deliver the finished product to your client and pocket the difference.

## The Strategy Behind the Craigslist Middleman Blueprint

The middleman strategy revolves around three key tools:

### 1. Fiverr – Freelance Marketplace  
To make this strategy work, you’ll need to sign up on [Fiverr](https://bit.ly/FiVErr), a popular platform where freelancers offer a wide range of services at affordable prices. You’ll choose services like logo design or website creation and sell them at a higher price on Craigslist.

### 2. PayPal – Secure Payment Gateway  
PayPal allows you to invoice your clients and collect payments securely. It ensures you get paid upfront before outsourcing the work to a freelancer.

### 3. Craigslist – Online Marketplace  
Craigslist serves as your advertising platform. With millions of monthly visitors, it’s a good place to list services and attract potential buyers. Posting in high-population cities increases your chances of getting inquiries.

## Pros and Cons of The Craigslist Middleman Blueprint

### Pros:
1. **Affordable Startup Costs**: With just $97 (and optional tools), this business model is accessible for most budgets.
2. **Step-by-Step Training**: The course provides clear instructions, including ad templates and sales copy to help you get started.
3. **Potential for Additional Income**: As a side hustle, it has the potential to generate extra income with minimal effort.

### Cons:
1. **Craigslist’s Decline in Popularity**: The platform isn't as widely used as it once was, making it harder to reach a large audience.
2. **Listing Fees**: Posting ads on Craigslist in some cities costs $25, which can add up quickly.
3. **Risk of Zero Sales**: Despite your efforts, there’s no guarantee that your ads will generate sales.
4. **DIY Competition**: Many people now go directly to Fiverr to hire freelancers, bypassing the middleman entirely.

## Why I Decided Against Joining

After researching and testing a similar strategy, I found several red flags:
1. **Misleading Income Claims**: The program claims students can earn $1,750 in their first week, which seems unrealistic.
2. **Upsells With Limited Value**: Paying an extra $67 for “1-on-1 coaching” feels unnecessary given the course already costs $97.
3. **Refund Policy Concerns**: The program offers a "no-questions-asked" refund, but its terms suggest a more complicated process.

## Is The Craigslist Middleman Blueprint Legit?

While the course provides legitimate training and guidance, the high-income claims and lack of transparency raise concerns. The anonymity of the program’s creator and the absence of external testimonials make it difficult to trust its promises.

## Final Verdict: Is It Worth It?

Based on my research and experience, **The Craigslist Middleman Blueprint** isn’t worth the investment. Craigslist is no longer the powerhouse it once was, and the strategy heavily relies on outdated methods. Instead, I recommend exploring other side hustles or freelancing opportunities on platforms like [Fiverr](https://bit.ly/FiVErr) for more sustainable income options.
