## Introduction

In this article, we’ll explore **affiliate programs**, one of the most effective online opportunities to earn money from scratch. 

### What is an Affiliate?

An affiliate’s role is to **promote products or services** of another party (the "affiliate merchant") in exchange for a **commission** or another form of compensation. Promotion typically occurs through **referral links** or **promo codes**, which are used to convert users into potential customers.

When a user performs a **conversion action** (e.g., making a purchase, signing up for a service, or generating clicks or impressions) through your affiliate link, you earn a percentage of the revenue or another form of reward. 

Today, we’ll focus on the renowned **Amazon Affiliate Program** and how you can start earning through it.

## Why Choose Amazon?

Amazon offers over **250 million products** across various categories, available for both individual purchases and bulk orders (e.g., through **Amazon Business**, a platform dedicated to businesses). By leveraging Amazon’s affiliate program, you can promote its products on your website, social media pages, or other platforms and earn a **commission** on each sale.

### Benefits of Amazon’s Affiliate Program
1. **Wide Product Range**: Access to millions of products in different niches.
2. **High Commission Rates**: Earn up to **12% commission** per sale, depending on the product category.
3. **Ease of Use**: Promote products using **referral links** generated directly from your Amazon affiliate dashboard.
4. **Additional Earning Opportunities**: Get paid for promoting services like **Amazon Prime** (e.g., earn €3 for every successful Prime trial signup through your link).

This flexibility and earning potential make Amazon one of the best affiliate programs compared to alternatives like **Fiverr**, **eToro**, or **Flippa**.
