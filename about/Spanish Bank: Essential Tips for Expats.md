## Opening a Spanish Bank Account

### Resident vs. Non-Resident Accounts

In Spain, foreigners can choose between two types of bank accounts:
1. **Resident Accounts**: Available for those living permanently in Spain.
2. **Non-Resident Accounts**: Designed for temporary residents, with some specific requirements.

### Requirements for Non-Resident Accounts

To open a non-resident account, you’ll need:
- A **passport** or valid form of identification from your home country.
- A **non-resident certificate**, which can be obtained from a local police station. This certificate must be submitted within 15 days of opening your account.

Every two years, the bank may review your non-resident status. If your residency status changes, you are required to notify the bank and provide a copy of your **residence card** (*tarjeta de residencia*).

> **Tip**: Some banks may not request a non-resident certificate. If this requirement becomes a hassle, consider switching to another branch or bank for greater convenience.

### Prices and Services

For the most part, non-resident accounts offer similar services to resident accounts. However, there are a few key differences:
- **Credit Cards and Overdrafts**: Non-residents may find it harder to access these services.
- **Fees**: If the account fees for non-residents are significantly higher, it’s worth exploring alternative banks with more favorable terms.
