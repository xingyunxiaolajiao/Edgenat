# What is Fiverr? How to Make Money Using Fiverr

Fiverr is an online marketplace where freelancers and clients can connect to exchange services. Launched in 2010, its name originated from the initial pricing model, where freelancers offered services, called "gigs," for $5. Over the years, Fiverr has evolved, and today, it's a platform where you can build a career working from home, offering your skills and expertise for much more than $5.

## How to Find Clients on Fiverr

The following tips will help you kickstart your online business and attract clients on the Fiverr platform.

### 1. Identify Your Niche

Start by choosing gigs that are simple, quick to deliver, and have potential for expansion. For new sellers, it's essential to offer a small task for an affordable price to attract your first clients and gain positive reviews. Ask yourself:

- What service can you complete in 10–15 minutes for $5?
- Can you offer larger packages or bundle services to add value?
- Are there extras you could include later to expand your offerings?

If you can answer "yes" to these questions, you're on the right path to creating your first gig.

### 3. Know Your Value

While Fiverr's baseline price for gigs is $5, it's crucial to understand the value of your work and set prices accordingly. Avoid engaging in price wars. Instead, focus on creating a competitive yet sustainable pricing strategy.

A smart approach could involve starting with affordable services to build your reputation. Once you have a steady stream of positive reviews, you can gradually increase your prices.

> **Pro Tip:** Always deliver high-quality work, even for low-priced gigs. Satisfied clients leave positive reviews, which boost your profile and attract higher-paying customers.
